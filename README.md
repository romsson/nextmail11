CONTEXT

Is e-mail obsolete? As a matter of fact, we tend to gather more and more information in our inboxes: personal and professional communications, but also marketing and commercial ads, alerts and notifications from websites or social networks, search engines results, agendas, ... The current use also tends to widen: e-mail is not only used to fulfill inter-personal communication but also to exchange files, to gather RSS feeds or to pick up a date for a meeting. Many people rely on their inboxes to retrieve important information and to organize their daily work.

Do electronic messaging systems offer new solutions to answer these existing and future usages of e-mail? What will be the trends in e-mail software? E-mail solutions nowadays don't present huge differences with early ones : a 3-pane interface displaying email folders, a list of messages in chronological order and the content of the message currently selected.. Gmail was quite revolutionary with its new UI (thread list and thread view) and is considered as the major innovation lately. Social networks (Facebook) and broadcast medium (Twitter) enable to reach a broader audience while reducing unsolicited messages. Given this context, what will be the next innovations in e-mail software: Unified messaging system? Integration of tasks manager and agenda? Is e-mail really collaborative? And does e-mail solutions allow collaboration through e-mail? Can we (should we) share contacts, threads, encourage content sharing instead of exchanging files with e-mail?


WORKSHOP GOALS

This workshop aims at gathering the most relevant scientific and technical contributions, in order to enlighten the current key research on emails and to unveil some of the main upcoming trends. Scientific contributions either from core e-mail research or external fields are sought for, such as (but not limited to): IA (intelligent agents), NLP (email linguistic analysis), SNA (social network analysis), psychology (group interaction, graph communication analysis, ...), linguistic (stylistic changes from letter-writing to instant messaging jargon), human-computer interaction (user experience, design guidelines). As well as technical issues, efficient and emerging best practices based upon real life scenarii, user experience, security issues, legal archiving, new protocols may also be of interest.


TOPICS

Topics include but are not limited to:

- Email content analysis, information extraction, summarization
- Email social networks in enterprise
- Email management strategies within organizations
- Adaptative email agents and semantic agents
- Emails archives exploration, visualization, regulations and behaviors
- Email visual interfaces and human/computer interaction with emails
- Case studies, experiments and user studies on emails usages
- Benchmark and email testing datasets
- Interoperability over email with enterprise resources and legacy systems
- Semantic email and email mining
- Unified messaging and web interactions : instant messaging, RSS feeds, annotations, tagging
- Personal information management integration in email clients, pending task management
- Interaction between email , PIM and the mobility factor
- Facing the volume growth, do we need to replace the old protocols?
- Evolution of infrastructures and uses


SUBMISSION

All papers accepted for the NextMail'11 workshop will be included in the Workshop Proceedings published by IEEE Computer Society Press. Proceedings will be available at the workshop. Selected papers (after their expansion and revision) may be selected for book or special journal issues (editors contact pending).
